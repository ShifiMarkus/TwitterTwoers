Immediately after the user has typed height and street, 
the area of the building or its perimeter will be printed 
(depending on the length and width he entered)

If the user has chosen a triangular building,
he will be asked to enter the length and width 
and then he will be given the option of choosing whether to calculate the perimeter of the triangle or print it
